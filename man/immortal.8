.SH NAME
immortal \- starts and monitor a service
.SH SYNOPSIS
immortal [options] command arguments ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
immortal runs a command or script detached from the controlling terminal as a Unix daemon, it will supervise and restart the service if it has been terminated.
The service can be controled by querying a Unix socket "immortal.sock" or by using immortalctl(8).
.SH OPTIONS
Options start with one dash. Many of the options require an additional value next to them.


-d <dir>
        Change to directory <dir> before starting the command.

-e <dir>
        Set environment variables specified by files within the <dir>.
        For example, if <dir> is /tmp/env and contains 3 files:

        /tmp/env
            |--DEBUG  (contains true)
            |--DBHOST (contains 10.0.0.1)
            `--DBPASS (contains secret)

        An environment var is going to be created for each file, in this case:
            DEBUG=true
            DBHOST=10.0.0.1
            DBPASS=secret


-f <pidfile>
        Follow PID in <pidfile>.
        In some cases it is required to supervise applications that daemonize by default. Normally this kind of applications create a pidfile every time they fork, the one can be used to follow subsequent forks and avoid creating a race condition between the supervisor trying to start again the process and the forks created by the application.

        If using immortalctl(8) the color yellow on the Down column, helps to identify does process that have been forked and that currently are been supervised by the PID on the <pidfile>.
        When the supervised application forks and creates a <pidfile> a log entry (level DAEMON) will be created:

            Watching pid <int> on file <pidfile>

        The follow pid option has better performance on Unix/BSD due the kernel event notification mechanism kqueue(2).

-l <logfile>
        Write stdout/stderr to <logfile>.

-logger <command>
        A command <command> to pipe stdout/stderr from stdin.
        Besides writing logs locally by using the option -l, they can be sent to a remote host or by processed by another tool, for example to write logs locally and send logs remotely using logger this could be used:

            -l /var/log/app.log --logger "logger -h 10.0.0.1 -t app"

        To only send log remotely using filebeat:

            --logger "filebeat -c filebeat.yml -v -once"

-P <pidfile>
        Path to write the supervisor pidfile.

-p <pidfile>
        Path to write the child pidfile.

-s <seconds>
        Seconds (int) <secods> to wait before starting.

-u <user>
        Execute the command on behalf <user>.

-v
        Print version.

-c <service name>.yml
        A configuration file with valid YAML syntax, when using this option, it will overwrite other options, configuration format:

        cmd: <command to execute>
        cwd: <change workding directory> # option -d
        env:                             # option -e
            <key>: <value>
        pid:
            follow: <pidfile>            # option -f
            parent: <pidfile>            # option -P
            child: <pidfile>             # option -p
        log:
            file: <path>                 # option -l
            age: <int>   # seconds
            num: <int>   # int
            size: <int>  # MegaBytes
        logger: <command>                # option -logger
        user: <user>                     # option -u
        wait: <int>                      # option -s


-ctl /var/run/immortal/<service>
        Path where the supervise directory will be created. This directory is unique per service and is used to manage the service via a Unix socket besides preventing running multiple times the same service by using a lock.

        A supervise directory containing two files:
           lock
           immortal.sock

        When calling immortal from the command line, not by using immortaldir(8) as root, the supervise directory, will be created on a hidden directory named ".immortal" within the $HOME of the user:

        ~/.immortal/<PID>

        This helps to run and supervise the same command multiple times without colliding, useful for testing or for temporary services that will exit when server reboots.

        To keep services up and running on boot time, is better to create a configuration file "run.yml" and use immortaldir(8).
