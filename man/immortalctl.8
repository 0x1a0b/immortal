.SH NAME
immortalctl \- control services started by immortal(8)
.SH SYNOPSIS
immortalctl [options] [-12achikinouqstvw] [*|service]
.SH DESCRIPTION
immortalctl by default prints the status of any available processes started by immortal(8), it first searches for user process located in $HOME/.immortal and next on the system global services started by immortaldir(8) located by default in /var/run/immortal unless this has been changed by defining the environment var IMMORTAL_SDIR.

When no services found the output will be a single row only with the headers:

            PID   Up   Down   Name   CMD

    PID    Print the current pid of the service that is been supervised

    Up     Display the time the application has been running and in color green

    Down   Display the time the application has been down and in color red, when in color yellow means that immortal(8) is following a pid, see immortal(8) option -f.

    Name   If the service has been started with immortaldir(8) it will be a string matching the name of the service.yml file, if the service has been run from command line calling directly immortal(8) it will be a PID

    CMD    The command that is been supervised

An option or signal can be sent to all the services by using a * instead of the service name.
.SH OPTIONS

exit      Stop service and supervisor, when following a pid it will only exit the supervisor, normally this option should not be used since the required behavior is to keep the service running forever.

start     Start the service.

status    Print status.
